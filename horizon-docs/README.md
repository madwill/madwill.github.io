# RethinkDB Horizon Docs

This is the repository for the Horizon documentation. As with RethinkDB's documentation, these are maintained in [GitHub-Flavored Markdown][GFM], using [Jekyll][] and [Kramdown][].

[GFM]:      https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/
[Jekyll]:   https://jekyllrb.com
[Kramdown]: http://kramdown.gettalong.org

If you're previewing our documentation, it's suggested you call Kramdown with these arguments:

    kramdown -i GFM --no-hard-wrap --coderay-line-numbers nil --toc-levels 1,2

These fairly closely match our HTML rendering.
